# Rate My Campus üåê MERN Stack Application

### Introduction
The purpose of this application is to help prospective students make informed decisions about which post-secondary school to attend.  I was motivated to make this application after spending time at several university campuses with varying degrees of success.  Through my years of studying, I found that the university environment played a large role in my enthusiasm and motivation for education.  With this web application, students can share experiences and provide feedback to help future students decide where to enroll.

More importantly, I created this project to practice building a full stack application from scratch using **React, Node.js, MongoDB and Express.**
