# Rate My Campus üåê MERN Stack Application

## Introduction
The purpose of this application is to help prospective students make informed decisions about which post-secondary school to attend.  I was motivated to make this application after spending time at several university campuses throughout my education with varying degrees of success.  With this web application, students can share experiences and provide feedback to help future students decide where to enroll.

More importantly, I created this project to practice building a full stack application from scratch using **React, Node.js, MongoDB and Express.**

## Features
- Centralized application state with Redux/Redux Toolkit
- React hooks including useEffect and useState
- Authentication with Bcrypt and JSON Web Tokens
- Image upload with Cloudinary
- Geocoding with Mapbox
